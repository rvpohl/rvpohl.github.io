<i>Abstract:</i> 
We estimate the causal effect of accidents on employment and earnings among
Chilean men using event study methods and monthly administrative data. An accident
of any type reduces the probability of being employed by 8.4 percentage points in the
first year, by 11.2 percentage points in the second year, and by 14.8 percentage points
in the third year after the accident. On average, over the three years after the accident,
employment declines by 14%, relative to the pre-accident mean. In addition, accidents
reduce monthly earnings by around 11% in the first year, 17% in the second year, and
22% in the third year after the accident. On average, monthly earnings fall by 16%,
relative to the pre-accident average. Thus, we estimate persistent and increasing labor
market eects of accidents over time. These effects vary by individuals' age, education,
and industry and by severity of the accident. Our findings imply that the economic
consequences of health shocks go beyond direct medical expenses.
