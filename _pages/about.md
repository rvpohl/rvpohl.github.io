I am a health and labor economist and currently a Researcher at [Mathematica](https://www.mathematica.org), where I focus on the evaluation of health policies and programs. My independent research is on the labor market effects of health and health insurance, long-term care, and the opioid crisis. Previously, I was an Assistant Professor at the [University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu) and at [Queenâ€™s University](https://www.queensu.ca). I received my undergraduate degree from the [University of Mannheim](https://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de) and my PhD from [Yale University](https://economics.yale.edu).
